# Survey Data Research Interface

## What This Project Is

This website is a clean and well-organized space for exploring survey data with confidence. It brings together responses from two patient safety surveys and presents them in a way that is easy to browse, understand, and trust.

Whether you are reviewing the data for research purposes, checking its accuracy, or simply trying to understand what participants said, this interface is designed to make the process straightforward and comfortable.

The core goal is clarity and trust. Every response is shown exactly as it was collected, and every coded value is directly connected to its original answer. Nothing is hidden, nothing is modified, and everything is easy to follow.

## The Data

This website contains **two complete survey projects**.

- **Survey One** includes responses from healthcare professionals working in hospital settings, focusing on patient safety practices and perceptions.
    
- **Survey Two** focuses on staff working in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), exploring similar patient safety themes within a more specialized environment.
    

Each survey contains **one hundred individual responses**. For every response, you can view:

- The original answer exactly as written
    
- The coded numerical version used for analysis
    

The original responses and their coded values are always kept together, allowing you to clearly see how each answer was translated.

All data is complete and intact. Every question, every response, and every detail has been preserved as originally collected. There are no missing entries and no alterations to the original content.

## How the Data Is Organized

The website is built around simplicity and clarity.

When you open the site, you will see the two survey projects clearly listed. Selecting a project takes you directly into its dataset.

Within each survey, you can choose how to view the data:

- Original responses only
    
- Coded values only
    
- Original and coded data side by side
    

The side-by-side view is especially useful for understanding how specific answers were converted into numerical codes.

All responses are displayed in a clear table format:

- Each row represents one respondent
    
- Each column represents one survey question
    

You can sort columns to group similar answers, search for specific words or patterns, or follow a single respondent across all questions.

A dedicated **codebook section** is also available. Whenever you see a number and want to know what it represents, the codebook provides a clear explanation.

## Key Features of the Website

The design is intentionally calm and minimal. There are no distractions, no complex menus, and no unnecessary visual elements. The focus stays on the data.

You can easily switch between raw responses and coded values. Coded data is clearly highlighted, and when both views are shown together, they align perfectly for natural comparison.

The tables are interactive and responsive. You can sort, search, and navigate through the data smoothly and efficiently.

Most importantly, the presentation is reliable. The data you see is exactly what was collected, and the coding is applied consistently across all responses. This makes the website suitable for serious research review, where accuracy and trust are essential.

## Who This Website Is For

This platform is designed for anyone who needs to understand survey data clearly and confidently.

Researchers can use it to review datasets before analysis or to verify coding consistency. Reviewers can explore the data behind reported findings. Students can learn how real survey data is collected and organized by browsing actual responses.

No technical background is required. You do not need to know how the website was built. All you need is curiosity and an interest in understanding the data.
