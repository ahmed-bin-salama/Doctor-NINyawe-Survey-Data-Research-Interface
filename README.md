Survey Data Research Interface
What This Project Is
This website is a clean, organized space for exploring survey data. It brings together responses from two patient safety surveys and presents them in a way that is easy to browse, understand, and trust. Whether you are reviewing the data for research, checking its accuracy, or simply trying to understand what people said, this interface makes the process straightforward and comfortable.
The goal is simple: to give you confidence in the data. Every response is displayed exactly as it was collected, and every coded value is clearly linked back to the original answer. Nothing is hidden, nothing is altered, and everything is easy to find.
The Data
This website contains two complete survey projects.
Survey One gathered responses from healthcare professionals working in hospital settings about patient safety practices and perceptions. Survey Two focused specifically on staff working in neonatal intensive care units (NICU), exploring similar themes within that specialized environment.
Each survey includes one hundred individual responses. For every single response, you can view the original words as they were written, and you can also see how those answers were translated into numbers for analysis. The original responses and the coded versions are kept together, so you can always see the connection between what someone said and how it was recorded.
All the data is here. Every response, every question, every detail has been preserved exactly as it was collected. There are no gaps, no missing entries, and no changes to the original answers.
How the Data Is Organized
The website is built around clarity. When you open it, you will see two main survey projects listed at the top. Clicking on either one takes you directly into that dataset.
Within each survey, you can move between different ways of viewing the data. You can look at the original responses on their own, the coded numbers on their own, or both side by side. This side-by-side view is especially helpful when you want to understand how a particular answer was translated into a code.
The responses are arranged in a clear table format. Each row represents one person who took the survey, and each column represents one question. You can sort the columns to group similar answers together, search for specific words or patterns, or jump to a particular respondent if you want to follow one person's answers all the way through.
There is also a dedicated codebook section that explains what each number means. If you see a code and want to know what it represents, the codebook gives you the answer immediately.
Key Features of the Website
The design is intentionally calm and simple. There are no distractions, no overwhelming colors, and no complicated menus. The focus stays on the data itself.
You can switch easily between raw responses and coded values. When viewing coded data, the numbers are highlighted so they stand out clearly. When viewing both together, the two versions line up perfectly, making comparison natural and intuitive.
The tables are interactive. You can sort by any column, search across all responses, and move through the data page by page. Everything responds quickly and smoothly.
Most importantly, the presentation is reliable. The data you see is the data that was collected. The codes you see are applied consistently across all responses. This makes the website suitable for serious research review, where accuracy and trust matter.
Who This Website Is For
This platform is designed for anyone who needs to understand survey data clearly and confidently.
Researchers will find it valuable for reviewing datasets before analysis or for checking that coding was done consistently. Reviewers can use it to verify findings or to explore the data behind published results. Students can browse real survey responses to learn how data collection and coding work in practice.
Really, it is for anyone who wants to see what people said and how those answers were organized. You do not need any technical background. You do not need to know how websites are built. You just need curiosity and a desire to understand the data.
Getting Started
Simply open the website and choose a survey. From there, explore freely. Switch between views, search for specific responses, and use the codebook whenever you want to understand what a number means.
The data is ready when you are.
